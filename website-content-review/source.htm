      <br>VA has selected 18 medical centers to lead the way in the department�s efforts to transform the nation�s
      largest integrated health care system into a high reliability organization (HRO). Pioneered in highly complex
      environments, such as aviation and nuclear energy, HROs put procedures and protocols in place that maximize safety
      and minimize harm, which in the medical industry assures every patient receives excellent care, every time.

      <br><br><br><br>


      <h3>What is Modernization?</h3>

      <br>This video was created using audio from Secretary Wilkie's Congressional testimony to promote the progress
      being made in Modernization efforts within VA. The target audience was internal viewers, but this could appeal to
      many audiences and could be shown far and wide.

      <br>This video was made to promote the VA's Best Places to Work survey. Input gathered in this survey helps VA
      leaders tailor their programs, policies and procedures to make improvements, and Secretary Wilkie was interested
      in getting wide participation. Target audience was internal viewers and the goal was to compel people to believe
      taking the survey is important, and that their feedback is welcome and valuable.

      <h3>Introduction to VA Telehealth Services</h3>

        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
      <br>VA telehealth bridges health care access and expertise across distances that otherwise separate some Veterans
      � especially those living in rural areas � from the providers best able to serve them. Learn more about telehealth
      services at www.telehealth.va.gov, and contact your care team to develop a care plan that works best for you.

      <h3>VHA Talks: 3D Printing</h3>
      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="./MOD Video_files/E-4XKf51qow.html" frameborder="0"
        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
      <br>3D Printing focuses on using 3D printing to enhance the care of Veterans by improving understanding of complex
      patient anatomy. As medicine continues to advance, there are more and more minimally invasive treatment strategies
      for diseases such as cancer (renal tumor 3D printed model) and heart failure. This means surgical incisions are
      smaller, portions of vital organs are increasingly spared and patients recover faster. Medical imaging coupled
      with 3D printing can play a role in planning for these procedures by allowing physicians the opportunity to see
      and interact with patient anatomy before a patient goes to the operating room. Our hope is that 3D printing will
      speed treatment and recovery of Veterans.

      <br>Before receiving her new hearing aid equipment in early 2017, Hartley had been using hearing aid devices for
      years. Some were helpful at times, but most fell short of her expectations. She needed help -- and to her relief,
      she had finally found it. Thanks to cutting-edge VA technologies called Telehealth, new hearing aid equipment and
      support from her friends at the Key West VA Clinic, Hartley found a solution that is finally working for her.

      <br>At VA, our goal is to prevent suicide among all Veterans, including those who do not and may never, come to us

      community.
