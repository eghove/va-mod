          VA has selected 18 medical centers to lead the way in the department's efforts to transform the nation's
          largest integrated health care system into a high reliability organization (HRO). Pioneered in highly complex
          environments, such as aviation and nuclear energy, HROs put procedures and protocols in place that maximize
          safety
          and minimize harm, which in the medical industry assures every patient receives excellent care, every time.
